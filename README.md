# Word Scramble 🤓

This is a very simple as well as easy game of guessing what word is in a scatter of letters. Each word is accompanied by a hint. 🧩

There are two levels of difficulty, the easy level has no time limit, while the hard level has a time limit. ⏱️

If the player scores five points - he wins. On the other hand, if he makes five mistakes or runs out of time in the hard level - he loses. ✨
